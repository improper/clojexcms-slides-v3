# Use case

Website with frontend and backend, simple CMS. Frontend rendered server-side for search engines.

# Light Table

* mediocre vim support
* Explain window panes
* Connections
* Docs (^D)
* Plugins
* Keymaps
* Cursive
* internal vs. external browser
* large CSS: impossible!

# Live coding

* Still experimental, some glitches, but already useful
* Many questions unanswered for me. More questions than answers.
* Server startup

# Structure

* Development environment
* Server
* Client

# Building blocks

# Live demo

# Conclusion

State of the art web development with all bells and whistles is a complex bitch.

Current state of clojexcms:

* needs refactoring
* needs auth
* don't overwrite local content changes, warn instead
* help/pull requests welcome
